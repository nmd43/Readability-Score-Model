At some point, you might want to change the host name of the system on which you have installed Unified Manager. For example, you might want to rename the host to more easily identify your Unified Manager servers by type, workgroup, or monitored cluster group.


The steps required to change the host name are different depending on whether Unified Manager is running on a VMware ESXi server, on a Red Hat or CentOS Linux server, or on a Microsoft Windows server.
