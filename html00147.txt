You can use the Active IQ Unified Manager user interface to generate on demand backup whenever required. The on-demand backup enables you to instantaneously create a backup using the existing backup method. The on-demand backup does not differentiate between MySQL or NetApp Snapshot based backup.


You can perform on-demand backup using the Backup Now button on the Database Backup page. The on-demand backup does not depend on the schedules that you have configured for Active IQ Unified Manager.
