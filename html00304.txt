Cluster compliance categories

This table describes the cluster security compliance parameters that Unified Manager evaluates, the NetApp recommendation, and whether the parameter affects the overall determination of the cluster being complaint or not complaint.


Having non-compliant SVMs on a cluster will affect the compliance value for the cluster. So in some cases you may need to fix a security issues with an SVM before your cluster security is seen as compliant.


Note that not every parameter listed below appears for all installations. For example, if you have no peered clusters, or if you have disabled AutoSupport on a cluster, then you will not see the Cluster Peering or AutoSupport HTTPS Transport items in the UI page.










Parameter
Description
Recommendation
Affects Cluster Compliance





Global FIPS


Indicates if Global FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 compliance mode is enabled or disabled. When FIPS is enabled, TLSv1 and SSLv3 are disabled, and only TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 are allowed.


Enabled


Yes




Telnet


Indicates if Telnet access to the system is enabled or disabled. NetApp recommends Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote access.


Disabled


Yes




Insecure SSH Settings


Indicates if SSH uses insecure ciphers, for example ciphers beginning with *cbc.


No


Yes




Login Banner


Indicates if the Login banner is enabled or disabled for users accessing the system.


Enabled


Yes




Cluster Peering


Indicates if communication between peered clusters is encrypted or unencrypted. Encryption must be configured on both the source and destination clusters for this parameter to be considered compliant.


Encrypted


Yes




Network Time Protocol


Indicates if the cluster has one or more configured NTP servers. For redundancy and best service NetApp recommends that you associate at least three NTP servers with the cluster.


Configured


Yes




OCSP


Indicates if there are applications in ONTAP that are not configured with OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) and therefore communications are not encrypted. The non-compliant applications are listed.


Enabled


No




Remote Audit Logging


Indicates if log forwarding (Syslog) is encrypted or not encrypted.


Encrypted


Yes




AutoSupport HTTPS Transport


Indicates if HTTPS is used as the default transport protocol for sending AutoSupport messages to NetApp support.


Enabled


Yes




Default Admin User


Indicates if the Default Admin User (built-in) is enabled or disabled. NetApp recommends locking (disabling) any unneeded built-in accounts.


Disabled


Yes




SAML Users


Indicates if SAML is configured. SAML enables you to configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a login method for single sign-on.


No


No




Active Directory Users


Indicates if Active Directory is configured. Active Directory and LDAP are the preferred authentication mechanisms for users accessing clusters.


No


No




LDAP Users


Indicates if LDAP is configured. Active Directory and LDAP are the preferred authentication mechanisms for users managing clusters over local users.


No


No




Certificate Users


Indicates if a certificate user is configured to log into the cluster.


No


No




Local Users


Indicates if local users are configured to log into the cluster.


No


No




Remote Shell


Indicates if RSH is enabled. For security reasons, RSH should be disabled. The Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote access is preferred.


Disabled


Yes




MD5 in Use


Indicates if ONTAP user accounts use less-secure MD5 Hash function. The MD5 Hashed user accounts migration to the more secure cryptographic hash function like SHA-512 is preferred.


No


Yes




Certificate Issuer Type


Indicates the type of digital certificate used.


CA-Signed


No
