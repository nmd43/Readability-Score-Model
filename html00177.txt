The following diagram shows the actions you must take (in green) and the action that Unified Manager takes (in black) when resolving events that were generated from the Active IQ platform.







When performing a manual resolution you must log into System Manager or the ONTAP command-line interface to fix the issue. You will be able to verify the issue only after the cluster generates a new AutoSupport message at midnight.
