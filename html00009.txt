Events generated from system-defined performance thresholds indicate that a performance counter, or set of performance counters, for a certain storage object has crossed the threshold from a system-defined policy. This indicates that the storage object, for example, an aggregate or node, is experiencing a performance issue.


You use the Event details page to analyze the performance event and take corrective action, if necessary, to return performance back to normal.









System-defined threshold policies are not enabled on Cloud Volumes ONTAP, ONTAP Edge, or ONTAP Select systems.
