The Support and Diagnostics menu enables you to generate a support bundle that you can send to technical support for troubleshooting assistance.


The following menu options are available:




Generate Light Support Bundle

Enables you to produce a lightweight support bundle that contains just 30 days of logs and configuration database records — it excludes performance data, acquisition recording files, and server heap dump.



Generate Support Bundle

Enables you to create a full support bundle (7-Zip file) containing diagnostic information in the diagnostic user’s home directory. If your system is connected to the internet you can also upload the support bundle to NetApp.


The file includes information generated by an AutoSupport message, the contents of the Unified Manager database, detailed data about the Unified Manager server internals, and verbose-level logs not normally included in AutoSupport messages or in the lightweight support bundle.
