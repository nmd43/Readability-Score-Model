As a storage administrator you can use the CLI commands to perform queries on the storage objects; for example, on clusters, aggregates, volumes, qtrees, and LUNs. You can use the CLI commands to query the Unified Manager internal database and the ONTAP database. You can also use CLI commands in scripts that are executed at the beginning or end of an operation or are executed when an alert is triggered.


All commands must be preceded with the command um cli login and a valid user name and password for authentication.








For running the um run command, ensure that your account has the console application access.












CLI command
Description
Output





um cli login -u <username> [-p <password>]


Logs in to the CLI. Because of security implications, you should enter only the user name following the "-u" option. When used in this manner you will be prompted for the password, and the password will not be captured in the history or process table. The session expires after three hours from the time of login, after which the user must login again.


Displays the corresponding message.




um cli logout


Logs out of the CLI.


Displays the corresponding message.




um help


Displays all first level subcommands.


Displays all first level subcommands.




um run cmd [ -t <timeout> ] <cluster> <command>


The simplest way to run a command on one or more hosts. Mainly used for alert scripting to get or perform an operation on ONTAP. The optional timeout argument sets a maximum time limit (in seconds) for the command to complete on the client. The default is 0 (wait forever).


As received from ONTAP.




um run query <sql command>


Executes an SQL query. Only queries that read from the database are allowed. Any update, insert, or delete operations are not supported.


Results are displayed in a tabular form. If an empty set is returned, or if there is any syntax error or bad request, it displays the appropriate error message.




um datasource add -u <username> -P <password> [ -t <protocol> ] [ -p <port> ] <hostname-or-ip>


Adds a datasource to the list of managed storage systems. A datasource describes how connections to storage systems are made. The options -u (username) and -P (password) must be specified when adding a datasource. The option -t (protocol) specifies the protocol used to communicate with the cluster (http or https). If the protocol is not specified, then both protocols will be attempted The option -p (port) specifies the port used to communicate with the cluster. If the port is not specified, then the default value of the appropriate protocol will be attempted. This command can be executed only by the storage admin.


Prompts for the user accept the certificate and prints the corresponding message.




um datasource list [ <datasource-id>]


Displays the datasources for managed storage systems.


Displays the following values in tabular format: ID Address Port, Protocol Acquisition Status, Analysis Status, Communication status, Acquisition Message, and Analysis Message.




um datasource modify [ -h <hostname-or-ip> ] [ -u <username> ] [ -P <password> ] [ -t <protocol> ] [ -p <port> ] <datasource-id>


Modifies one or more datasource options. Can be executed only by the storage admin.


Displays the corresponding message.




um datasource remove <datasource-id>


Removes the datasource (cluster) from Unified Manager.


Displays the corresponding message.




um option list [ <option> .. ]


Lists all the options that you can configure using the set command.


Displays the following values in tabular format: Name, Value, Default Value, and Requires Restart.




um option set <option-name>=<option-value> [ <option-name>=<option-value> …​ ]

Displays the corresponding message.
