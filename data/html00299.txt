Aggregate events provide you with information about the status of aggregates so that you can monitor for potential problems. Events are grouped by impact area and include the event and trap name, impact level, source type, and severity.




Impact area: availability


An asterisk (*) identifies EMS events that have been converted to Unified Manager events.
