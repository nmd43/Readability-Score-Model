Active IQ Unified Manager provides you with REST APIs to view the information about monitoring and managing your storage environment. APIs also allow provisioning and managing storage objects based on policies.


You can also execute ONTAP APIs on all ONTAP-managed clusters by using the API gateway supported by Unified Manager.
