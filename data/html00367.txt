Contributors
  







Connectivity events provide you with information about the connectivity between the components of a cluster and between clusters in MetroCluster over FC and MetroCluster over IP configurations, so that you can monitor for potential problems. Events are grouped by impact area and include the event and trap name, impact level, source type, and severity.
