Installing Active IQ Unified Manager


Download the installer



Download the ActiveIQUnifiedManager-<version>.zip installation package along with code signing certificate (.pem) and digital signature (.sig) .


In the directory where you have downloaded the installation file, run:

# unzip ActiveIQUnifiedManager-<version>.zip






Verify integrity

Run the following commands to verify the integrity of the installer package:




Run openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in AIQUM-RHEL-CLIENT-INTER-ROOT.pem > <public_key_file_name> to create a file with the public key from the code signing certificate.


Run openssl dgst -sha256 -verify <public_key_file_name> -signature <signature_file_name> ActiveIQUnifiedManager-<version>.zip to verify the signature on the installer package.





Verify repository configuration

The procedures for configuring Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS repositories are site specific. You can use the pre_install_check.sh script included in the installation package to verify the configuration of your operating system. If your system is connected to the internet, you automatically receive instructions for setting up the Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS repositories.


# sudo ./pre_install_check.sh



Install Unified Manager

Unified Manager uses the yum utility to install the software and any dependent software. Because there are varying images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, the packages installed depend on the software present in the images. The yum utility determines the dependent software packages for installation. If you need more information on the dependent software packages, see the Linux software and installation requirements.


To install Unified Manager, run the following command, either as the root user or using sudo, from the directory where the installation file was unzipped:


# yum install netapp-um<version>.x86_64.rpm


or


% sudo yum install netapp-um<version>.x86_64.rpm


At the end of the installation, the information to connect to the Unified Manager web UI is displayed. If you are unable to connect to the web UI, refer to the README file packaged with the software for more information about port 443 restrictions.
