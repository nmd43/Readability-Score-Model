Using the Node Failover Planning page to determine corrective actions

Based on the information that is displayed in the Performance/Node Failover Planning page, you can take actions to ensure that a failover does not cause the performance of an HA pair to drop below an acceptable level.


For example, to reduce the estimated performance impact of a failover, you can move some volumes or LUNs from a node in the HA pair to other nodes in the cluster. Doing so ensures that the primary node can continue to deliver acceptable performance after a failover.
