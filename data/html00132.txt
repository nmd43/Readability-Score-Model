You can prevent performance issues for mirrored workloads in a MetroCluster over FC and IP configurations by ensuring that the MetroCluster configuration is set up correctly. You can also improve workload performance by changing the configuration or upgrading software or hardware components.


Refer to MetroCluster Documentation for the instructions of setting up the clusters in the MetroCluster configuration, including the Fibre Channel (FC) switches, cables, and inter-switch links (ISLs). It also helps you configure the MetroCluster software so that the local and remote clusters can communicate with mirror volume data.
For information specific to your MetroCluster over IP setup, see Install a MetroCluster IP configuration.


You can compare your MetroCluster configuration to the requirements in MetroCluster Documentation to determine whether changing or upgrading components in your MetroCluster configuration might improve workload performance. This comparison can help you answer the following questions:




Are the controllers appropriate for your workloads?


Do you need to upgrade your ISL bundles to a larger bandwidth to handle more throughput?


Can you adjust the buffer-to-buffer credits (BBC) on your switches to increase the bandwidth?


If your workloads have high write throughput to solid state drive (SSD) storage, do you need to upgrade your FC-to-SAS bridges to accommodate the throughput?
