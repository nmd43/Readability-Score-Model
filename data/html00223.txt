Unified Manager uses a MySQL database to store data from the clusters that it is monitoring. Data is persisted into various schemas in the MySQL database.


All table data from the following databases are available:

A reporting user — a Database user with the Report Schema role — is able to access the data in these tables. This user has read-only access to reporting and other database views directly from the Unified Manager database. Note that this user does not have permission to access any tables that contain user data or cluster credential information.
