Active IQ Unified Manager 9.13







Backup and restore using NetApp Snapshots


06/29/2022
Contributors



A NetApp Snapshot copy creates a point-in-time image of the Unified Manager database and configuration files that you can use to restore in case of a system failure or data loss. You schedule a Snapshot copy to be written to a volume on one of your ONTAP clusters periodically so that you always have a current copy.









This functionality is not available for Active IQ Unified Manager installed on a virtual appliance.
