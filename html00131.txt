You can use Unified Manager to review the health of the clusters in a MetroCluster configuration over IP or FC. The health status and events help you determine whether there are hardware or software issues that might be impacting the performance of your workloads.


If you configure Unified Manager to send email alerts, you can check your email for any health issues on the local or remote cluster that might have contributed to a performance event. In the Unified Manager GUI, you can select Event Management to see a list current events and then use the filters to display MetroCluster configuration events only.
