While events occur continuously, the Unified Manager generates an alert only when an event meets specified filter criteria. You can choose the events for which alerts should be generated—​for example, when a space threshold is exceeded or an object goes offline. You can also associate an alert with a script that is executed when an alert is triggered.


Filter criteria include object class, name, or event severity.
