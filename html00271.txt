Role-based access control (RBAC) enables administrators to manage groups of users by defining roles. If you need to restrict access for specific functionality to selected administrators, you must set up administrator accounts for them. If you want to restrict the information that administrators can view and the operations they can perform, you must apply roles to the administrator accounts you create.


The management server uses RBAC for user login and role permissions. If you have not changed the management server’s default settings for administrative user access, you do not need to log in to view them.


When you initiate an operation that requires specific privileges, the management server prompts you to log in. For example, to create administrator accounts, you must log in with Application Administrator account access.
